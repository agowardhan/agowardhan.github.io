<h1>Teaching</h1>
<hr/>

<p> As a graduate student in the Cornell Astronomy department, I have taught for the intro to astronomy course for non-majors (Astro 1101), as well as the writing courses Astro 2201 and 2202. In 2017, I was awarded the Cranson and Edna B. Shelley Teaching Assistant Award,  2017, for my teaching work.
