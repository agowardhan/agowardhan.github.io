As a graduate student in the Cornell Astronomy department, I have taught for the intro to astronomy course for non-majors [Astro 1101](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA18/class/ASTRO/1101), 
as well as the writing courses [Astro 2201](http://hosting.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro2201/) and [Astro 2202](http://hosting.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro2202/). In 2017, I was awarded the Cranson and Edna B. Shelley Teaching Assistant Award for my teaching work.
