## Research 

- A bayesian framework for multi-wavelength source detection, *2016*
Optimized source detection in a multi-wavelength dataset using Python: the code identifies real astronomical sources given images from different instruments, and with different resolutions and sensitivity. 

- A Blind Ka/Q-band Survey for Molecular Absorption at High Redshift (Thesis Project)
 Advisor: Dr. Nissim Kanekar, National Center for Radio Astrophysics, India *(2013-2014)* 

A blind search for molecular absorbers using CO and HCO+ lines, to quantify the redshift number density of molecular absorbers; observations of 585 target sources in 32-48 GHz (Ka and Q bands) with the EVLA over a redshift 0.9 < z < 2.5, and with total redshift path ∆z = 188. Developed pipeline for blind search of spectral line features in > 500 galaxies (over 2 TB of data) using bash, Python, and Mathematica. Involved data cleaning, hypothesis testing, error propagation, line modeling. 

- Enhanced Sensitivity in Gravitational Wave Detection from Supernovae 
Advisor: Prof. Soma Mukherjee, CGWA, Center for Gravitational Wave Research, UT Brownsville *(Summer 2012)*

Improved search sensitivity for detection of GWs from supernovae by implementing Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithm using Matlab to enhance to enhance search sensitivity for detection of weak gravitational wave signals in LIGO data. Tested with simulated as well as LIGO fourth Science run data (S4). 

- Probing variation in fundamental constants using QSO Spectra 
Advisor: Dr. Nissim Kanekar, National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA), India, *Aug - Dec, 2012*

Searched for a fractional change in the value of the fine structure constant over cosmological timescales using cross-correlation of SiIV doublet absorption lines in QSO spectra from Keck/HIRES.
