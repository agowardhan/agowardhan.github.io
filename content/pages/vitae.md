## Research 

- A bayesian framework for multi-wavelength source detection, *2016*
Optimized source detection in a multi-wavelength dataset using Python: the code identifies real astronomical sources given images from different instruments, and with different resolutions and sensitivity. 

- A Blind Ka/Q-band Survey for Molecular Absorption at High Redshift (Thesis Project, NCRA), *(2013-2014)* 
 Developed pipeline for blind search of CO and HCO+ spectral line features to quantify the redshift number density of molecular absorbers in > 500 galaxies between 0.9 < z < 2.5  using Python, and Mathematica. 

- Enhanced Sensitivity in Gravitational Wave Detection from Supernovae, CGWA, UT Brownsville *(May-August, 2012)*
Improved search sensitivity for detection of GWs from supernovae by implementing Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithm using Matlab to enhance to enhance search sensitivity for detection of weak gravitational wave signals in LIGO data. Tested with simulated as well as LIGO fourth Science run data (S4). 

- Probing variation in fundamental constants using QSO Spectra, NCRA, *Aug - Dec, 2012*
Searched for a fractional change in the value of the fine structure constant over cosmological timescales using cross-correlation of SiIV doublet absorption lines in QSO spectra from Keck/HIRES.
